A game created in C++ with graphics to play Hangman and General Knowledge quiz.

As my and @VivekSoni's project for class 12, we created a game where one could play both Hangman and a General Kwoledge quiz. There were different levels where the difficulty of the quiz would change it was based on timer so each constestant gets a limited time to answer questions. 

The Game of Hangman comprised of random countries where would would predict letters and based on the correctness the game would continue.
